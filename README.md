# draft_picks 

A program I built in order to not have to learn anything about football for my draft.

The original plan was to try and make it a Rails project wherein I could remove players as they were drafted, but I ran out of time.

The current version runs in the command line.

Once the program is Ready, you can choose to display by position (qb, rb, te, wr, d, k) or view all positions sorted together by projected value. Use "top" to see the top 20, "20" to see 21-40, "40" to see 41 - 60, etc. "quit" to quit.

My value formula is just straight up incorrect. This will not help you draft a good fantasy football team.
